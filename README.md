This is the package recipe for folding@home controller.

It creates a package using the one provided for ubuntu/debian.

To build the modules for the current released version of packages os solus, just run ```./bouwme.sh```
To build it if you have a build environment for unstable ```make```

I had some issues with it, so made some changes to it.

Create a build environment using solbuild as described here: https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/building-a-package/en/
